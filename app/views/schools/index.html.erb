    <p>
      On XX/XX/XXXX, the School Reform commission voted to close 23 Philadelphia Public Schools. What happens next?
    </p>
    <p>
      This project will track news for each of the closing schools as the district moves to close them at the end
      of the school year. Each school has its own page, where you can find news about that school, as well as a forum for community input into what the City should do with the school.
